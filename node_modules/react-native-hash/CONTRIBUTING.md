As a reminder, all contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Drazail/react-native-hash/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to Contribute

If you are eager to start contributing code right away, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/drazail/react-native-hash/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. As you gain more experience and demonstrate a commitment to evolving React Native Hash, you may be granted issue management permissions in the repository.

There are other ways you can contribute without writing a single line of code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:

1. **Replying and handling open issues.** Some issues may lack necessary information. You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the issue template, asking for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues that match their description of the problem.
2. **Reviewing pull requests for the docs.** Reviewing documentation updates can be as simple as checking for spelling and grammar. If you encounter situations that can be explained better in the docs, click **Edit** at the top of most docs pages to get started with your own contribution.
3. **Help people write test plans.** Some pull requests sent to the main repository may lack a proper test plan. These help reviewers understand how the change was tested, and can speed up the time it takes for a contribution to be accepted.

Each of these tasks is highly impactful, and maintainers will greatly appreciate your help.
